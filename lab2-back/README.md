### Notes

Keycloak must be installed and configured separately, see [here](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-keycloak) and also [here if you are on Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Keycloak), I use Arch btw )))

Change application.yml accordingly

Registration does not work)))0)) Add users to the database manually. Also the Admin frontend activates only if the username == 'admin'. Other than that, it works, and the code is pretty simple.
